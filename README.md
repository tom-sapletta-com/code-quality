Examples of projects for making the code more clean amd reusable



## [Prettier Â· Opinionated Code Formatter](https://prettier.io/)
+ [prettier/prettier: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter.](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
 Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.


## [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.
